This is another repository to see more examples of automated tests developed by myself and also related to the "test automation with selenium" course from the linkedIn platform and also to automation test tutorials from the "Quality-Stream" youtube channel. However, it is not made using the Maven tool, which means that dependencies are not as easily managed and not as used as with Maven (must be included with External JAR files and not XML format) and therefore it includes less functionality than the "testing_example_01".
